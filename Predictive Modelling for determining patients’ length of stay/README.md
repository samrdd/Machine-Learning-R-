- The Logistic Regression is only working using lgm 
- ALSO, the Logistic Regression Matrix isnt working, I was trying to experiment with ways to calculate accuracy. LMK if you know how to do that with lgm! 
- KNN takes FOREVER on my laptop, but still works! just takes ages to load. 
- Dtree was giving me .79 accuracy but then it started returning 1? not sure what that was about lol 
- Included the Data preprocessing file too, I added a few things. 
- Feel free to check and let me know what I can change. This is one of the first times I've modeled in R so hopefully it isn't awful lmao
